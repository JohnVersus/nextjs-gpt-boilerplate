      <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4">Cancellation Policy</h2>

      <p className="mb-4">
        You may cancel your subscription to our SaaS product at any time through
        your account settings. Cancellations will take effect at the end of the
        current billing period, and you will retain access to the service until
        that time. We do not provide refunds for partial billing periods or
        unused features.
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4">Refund Policy</h2>

      <p className="mb-4">
        Refunds will only be considered in exceptional circumstances, such as
        when there has been an error in billing. To request a refund, please
        contact our customer service team within 7 days of the billing date. All
        refund requests are subject to review, and approval is at our sole
        discretion. If approved, the refund will be processed within 9-15
        business days.
      </p>

        Damaged or Defective Products
      </h2>

        Our SaaS product does not involve physical goods. If you encounter a
        technical issue with our service, please contact our support team for
        assistance. We do not offer refunds for technical issues unless our team
        determines that the issue was caused by a fault in our system that
        cannot be resolved.
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4">Product Mismatch</h2>

      <p className="mb-4">
        If the service you receive does not match the description provided or
        does not meet your expectations, please contact our customer service
        team within 7 days of purchase. We will review your case and take
        appropriate action, which may include a refund or service adjustment.
